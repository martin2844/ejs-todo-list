0.1 - first live version

0.2 - integrated mongoDB to work with the list -
    - removed work route, changed css style from form to form.item.
    - Still need to push to heroku to see if its working.

1.0 - added custom routes, if you go to /whateverYouWant, it will create that route
    - custom routes have different lists, meaning you can have infinite different lists.
    - changed the 'day' ejs value being sent, to 'today', in order for the code to work, since
    the day var was giving trouble on other lines of code.
    - Added MongoDB Atlas Server integration.
